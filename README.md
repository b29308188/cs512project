This is the project of CS512:  
Learning Word Embedding from Heterogeneous Knowledge Networks  


Graph: 
1. WordNet: Can be found in NLTK.  
2. BabelNet: Need investigation. 

Algorithm: 
To be continued...  

Evaluation: 
1. Unsupervised evaluations: https://github.com/kudkudak/word-embeddings-benchmarks  
2. POS tagging (LSTM): More suitable for our project?
